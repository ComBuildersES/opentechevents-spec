/**
 * Health check for registered adopter feeds: fetches every feed in
 * docs/data/adopters.json and validates it against the schemas of the spec
 * version the feed itself declares — not against the newest one. A feed that is
 * valid 0.3 is a healthy feed; publishing a new spec version must never turn
 * every adopter that hasn't migrated yet into a daily issue.
 *
 * Three separate signals, deliberately not collapsed into one boolean:
 *   - reachable  — answers with JSON at all
 *   - valid      — conforms to the schemas of its own declared version
 *   - current    — how its version compares to the newest one. Metadata only:
 *                  an old but supported version never opens an issue, it is
 *                  reported in docs/data/feed-health.json for consumers to see.
 *
 * Failures are also classed before they count. A timeout or a 5xx is transient
 * (slow origin, a bad afternoon) and needs to persist across most of a window of
 * runs; a 4xx, non-JSON body or schema error is deterministic and is reported
 * sooner. Both are tracked in .github/feed-health.json (committed by the
 * workflow, not published); the public status lives in docs/data/feed-health.json.
 *
 * Nothing is ever removed from the registry automatically — feeds die over a
 * weekend all the time, and delisting a community is a human call (a PR).
 *
 * With GITHUB_TOKEN + GITHUB_REPOSITORY set it manages the issues itself via the
 * REST API; without them (local run) it prints what it would do.
