/**
 * Turns an adopter-registration issue into an adopters.json entry.
 *
 * Reads the issue-form body from $ISSUE_BODY, fetches the feed, validates it with
 * the real schemas (the browser form only did a best-effort check — this is the
 * authoritative pass), and on success updates docs/data/adopters.json in place.
 * The workflow around it turns that change into a PR.
 *
 * Outputs (to $GITHUB_OUTPUT when set, stdout otherwise):
 *   valid=true|false   whether the feed validated
 *   name=<community>   for commit message / PR title
 *   spec=v0.3          the spec version this run measured against — the one the feed
 *                      declares, not necessarily the newest — for the PR body
 *   validator=<url>    the feed's permalink in the online validator, for the PR body
 * A human-readable report is written to $REPORT_PATH (default: adopter-report.md)
 * — that file becomes the comment on the issue, valid or not. It opens with a hidden
 * marker so the workflow can edit one sticky comment instead of stacking a new one on
 * every re-run, and every report carries the online validator link for this feed plus
 * the `/revalidate` command: the usual fix happens on the publisher's server, where
 * editing the issue changes nothing and there is otherwise no way to ask for a retry.
 *
 * An invalid feed is a normal outcome, not a job failure: the script only exits
 * non-zero when it cannot do its work (missing fields, unreadable adopters.json).
