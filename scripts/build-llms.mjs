/**
 * Publishes the repo as something a language model can read.
 *
 *   npm run build-llms            → writes the generated files
 *   npm run build-llms -- --check → fails if they are stale (CI, via `npm run validate`)
 *
 * Two shapes, because assistants differ in how much they can swallow in one fetch:
 *
 *   docs/llms.txt       → the index, ~4 KB. Every source with a one-line description and a URL,
 *                         in the llms.txt convention (https://llmstxt.org). An agent that can
 *                         only afford a few fetches reads this and picks.
 *   docs/llms-full.txt  → everything concatenated, for an agent with the context to hold it.
 *   docs/llms/<name>.md → the individual pieces, so the URLs in the index actually resolve.
 *
 * Nothing here is hand-maintained: the sources are the repo's own files, copied verbatim. A
 * paraphrase of the spec is a second spec, and the second one is always the one that goes stale.
