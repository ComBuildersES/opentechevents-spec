Every calendar client on earth reads it.",

Our survey rated h-event \"low priority\" as an HTML markup option, which is a decision about <em>output formats</em> — it never seriously tested whether the IndieWeb conventions should have shaped the model itself. That is a real gap in our homework, and feedback from people who have shipped h-event tooling would change our answer.",

      "fep.diff": "The distribution models genuinely differ: ActivityPub is a push protocol between actors on running servers, while OTE is a static file you can host on GitHub Pages. A community that cannot run a server can publish OTE today. That is complementary, not competing — an OTE ↔ FEP-8a8e adapter would let one published event reach the Fediverse.",
      "fep.open": "Are we modelling concepts — event identity, organisers, parent/child events, recurrence — in a way that conflicts with FEP-8a8e for no good reason? We would like this reviewed <em>before</em> the model stabilises, not after.",

      "cc.desc": "An aggregator built on the premise that <em>event producers are the authoritative sources for their own events</em>: publish once, individuals and aggregators pull. Its gold standard is iCalendar, with scrapers for sites that do not publish a feed. Udell has been making this argument since roughly 2008 — \"ICS is RSS for events\".",
      "cc.rel": "<strong>Why it matters to us:</strong> it is the sharpest challenge to OTE's existence. If iCalendar plus curation is enough, we should hear that from someone who has actually built the aggregator.",

      "meetable.desc": "A minimal event aggregator, deployed at events.indieweb.org, events.oauth.net and meet.modelcontextprotocol.io. Event pages, tags, iCal feeds, \"add to calendar\", RSVPs and Webmentions.",
      "meetable.rel": "<strong>Why it matters to us:</strong> a working example of a small, self-hosted directory — the kind of consumer OTE should be trivial to plug into — and evidence that iCal output is still what people want at the end.",
      "confstech.desc": "An open, community-curated dataset of tech conferences — JSON per topic and year, with name, dates, city, country, CFP URL and CFP deadline — contributed by pull request or through a web form.",
      "confstech.rel": "<strong>Why it matters to us:</strong> its schema is a directory's internal model, not a standard, and it works. The open question is whether organiser-maintained feeds would add anything to a curation model that already produces clean data.",

      "devevents.rel": "<strong>Why it matters to us:</strong> OTE is not an alternative to it. The goal is that directories like this one can consume data the organisers maintain themselves, instead of everyone re-typing the same conference.",

      "awesome.rel": "<strong>Why it matters to us:</strong> the low-tech end of the same problem — collect, deduplicate, keep fresh — and a plausible consumer if the data can be fetched instead of typed.",

      "s3.title": "3 · Which layer is each one in?",
      "s3.lead": "Most arguments about \"another event format\" are really arguments between different layers. A dot means the project covers that layer as a first-class concern — not that it does it best, and not that the others could not be extended to do it.",

      "s4.lead": "A page like this is easy to write persuasively and hard to write honestly. These are the load-bearing assumptions behind OTE that we have <em>not</em> demonstrated. If one of them turns out to be false, the right answer may well be to narrow OTE, turn it into a profile of an existing standard, or stop.",
      c1: "<strong>That the gap is real.</strong> We believe no widely adopted layer combines publish-from-the-source, syndication and a tech-event vocabulary. We have not measured adoption systematically, and \"we didn't find one\" is not \"there isn't one\".",
      c2: "<strong>That an aggregator saves work.</strong> No independent consumer has yet reported that ingesting OTE was less work than what they already do. Until one does, the efficiency argument is a hypothesis.",
      c3: "<strong>That reuse beats rolling your own.</strong> When a community needs structured events it is very easy to invent a small local <code>events.json</code> — that is what <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenRefine/openrefine.org/issues/506\">happens in practice</a>. Whether picking up OTE is genuinely easier than writing twenty lines of schema is untested.",
      c4: "<strong>That the schema.org mapping is 1:1.</strong> It is 1:1 on paper, from the field survey. The exporter is not built, so nothing has proved it end to end.",
      c5: "<strong>That we are not duplicating FEP-8a8e.</strong> We have not compared the models property by property. This is unreviewed work, not a settled conclusion.",
      c6: "<strong>That publishing is worth it for the organiser.</strong> If the only beneficiary is a future aggregator, the incentive to publish is weak. The immediate payoff — ICS, RSS, JSON-LD and a subscribe button from one file — is the bet, and it is only partly built.",

Si coger OTE es de verdad más fácil que escribir veinte líneas de schema está sin comprobar.",
